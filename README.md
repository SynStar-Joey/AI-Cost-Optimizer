# AI Cost Optimizer

A simple experimental project exploring ways to reduce AI API costs when building applications with large language models.

Many developers building AI products face rapidly increasing API costs.  
This repository explores ideas, examples, and experiments for improving cost efficiency when working with LLM APIs.

---

## Why this project exists

When building AI applications, developers often encounter:

- Rapidly increasing LLM API costs
- Difficulty comparing model performance vs cost
- Hard decisions about when to use cheaper models vs stronger models

This project explores simple approaches developers can experiment with to better understand cost-performance tradeoffs.

---

## What this repo contains

This repository includes:

- Example scripts for calling LLM APIs
- Basic experiments around AI cost efficiency
- Ideas for optimizing LLM usage in applications

The goal is to provide practical starting points for developers experimenting with AI infrastructure.

---

## Example

A simple example showing how a developer might call an AI model in a minimal application.

```python
# example.py

from synstar import chat

prompt = "Explain artificial intelligence in simple terms."

response = chat(prompt)

print(response)
```

This example demonstrates a simple AI request in a minimal setup.  
Developers can use similar scripts to experiment with different prompts, models, or cost strategies.

---

## Potential use cases

This type of experimentation can be useful for developers building:

- AI SaaS products
- AI agents
- Chatbots
- AI automation tools
- AI developer infrastructure

Understanding model cost vs performance is important for scaling AI products.

---

## Ideas explored in this project

Some ideas developers may experiment with include:

- Comparing cost across different AI models
- Testing smaller models for simpler tasks
- Measuring prompt efficiency
- Observing how different prompts affect token usage

These experiments can help teams better understand how to optimize AI usage.
